# About the Project

## üå± Inspiration
The growing need for sustainable and efficient agriculture inspired the **IoT Greenhouse Controller**. Managing greenhouse environments for optimal growth has become essential with climate change and resource scarcity. By leveraging IoT technology, our project aims to automate and optimize greenhouse conditions for precision agriculture, ensuring plants receive the perfect environment for growth.

## üìò What We Learned
Through this project, we gained hands-on experience with IoT sensors and actuators, including temperature, moisture, and light sensors, as well as control devices like DC motors. We even constructed a water pump using DC motors. Additionally, we learned about integrating these components into a real-time feedback system displayed on an LCD, which deepened our understanding of data-driven decision-making in environmental control systems. We also gained knowledge in 3D printing and used a 3D printer to create parts and the greenhouse structure.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It
The **IoT Greenhouse Controller** combines multiple sensors and control elements:

- **Temperature Sensor:** Monitors climate, triggering an air conditioner (simulated with a fan) to adjust the temperature.
- **Moisture Sensor:** Detects soil moisture levels, automatically activating the water pump when needed.
- **LDR Sensor:** Manages lighting for the plants, adjusting LED brightness as light conditions change.

All these components are enclosed in a 3D-modeled greenhouse environment, where the **16x2 LCD** provides real-time data, offering immediate insights into the system's operations.

## üöß Challenges
Building this project came with a few challenges:

1. **Sensor Calibration:** Ensuring the sensors accurately reflect real-world conditions was essential but time-consuming.
2. **Component Integration:** Each device and sensor required careful tuning to work seamlessly together.
3. **Visualization:** Creating an effective 3D model to represent the greenhouse setup required additional effort and design considerations.

Despite these challenges, the **IoT Greenhouse Controller** is a robust, smart solution for modern agriculture.
